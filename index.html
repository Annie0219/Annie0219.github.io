          <h2><strong>Yangyang</strong> (Annie) Li</h2>

          <p>
            Hi! I’m <strong>Yangyang (Annie) Li</strong>, a senior at the
            <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong>, double-majoring in
            <strong>Computer Science, Economics &amp; Data Science (6-14)</strong> and
            <strong>Business Analytics (15-2)</strong>. 
            With experience across research and competition settings, my goal is to 
            build autonomous, adaptive, and trustworthy embodied AI systems that can reason 
            about the world and remain reliable under uncertainty. I believe that robotics 
            and distributionally robust optimization hold transformative potential: together, 
            they offer a path toward solving some of the most complex and consequential challenges 
            in intelligent decision-making. 
            Along with research, in the past few years I've earned a few awards, such as
            (<em>Bain Cup Finalist</em>, <em>Regeneron STS Scholar</em>,
            <em>MSEF 2nd Place</em>, <em>Google Code Jam Top 1000</em>).
            Welcome to my website.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            My current research centers on <strong>robust and adaptive intelligence</strong>.
            I developed <strong>DRO-InstructZero</strong>, a distributionally robust
            Bayesian-optimization framework for <strong>Large Language Models</strong> that
            explicitly maximizes worst-case reliability under domain shift—bridging robustness
            theory with prompt alignment. This work, under review at ICLR 2026, establishes a
            principled connection between <strong>distributionally robust optimization</strong>
            and instruction learning.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            In parallel, I co-authored <strong>Adaptive Virtual Model Control with LLM- and
            Lyapunov-based Reinforcement Learning</strong>, recently submitted to ICASSP 2026.
            The study combines <strong>large-language-model guidance</strong> with
            <strong>Lyapunov-constrained RL</strong> to achieve physically interpretable yet
            stability-guaranteed robotic control—demonstrating that semantic reasoning from
            LLMs can enable autonomous decision-making in real-time machine control.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Across both lines of work—from robust LLM optimization to adaptive robotics
            control—my goal is to design learning systems that
            <strong>remain trustworthy when the world changes</strong>. I hope to pursue a Ph.D.
            that advances <strong>reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and AI robustness</strong>
            toward more reliable and interpretable intelligence.

                Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However, popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently, prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this, DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 ± 0.7% to approximately 85–90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25–30 points. Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift. Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment under real-world uncertainty.

                Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Virtual Model Control with LLM and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL), which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting stability-guaranteed online adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) provide structured priors and high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components, improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

                Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to partial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and the lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPSdenied, map-free conditions

                The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) offers a unique opportunity to examine the causal relationship between Medicaid coverage and happiness among low-income adults, using an experimental design. This study leverages data from comprehensive surveys conducted at 0 and 12 months post-treatment. Previous studies based on OHIE have shown that individuals receiving Medicaid exhibited a significant improvement in mental health compared to those who did not receive coverage. The primary objective is to explore how Medicaid coverage impacts happiness, specifically analyzing in which direction do variations in healthcare spending significantly improve mental health: higher spending or lower spending after Medicaid. Utilizing instrumental variable (IV) regression, I conducted six separate regressions across subgroups categorized by expenditure levels and happiness ratings, and the results reveal distinct patterns. Enrolling in OHP has significantly decreased the probability of experiencing unhappiness, regardless of whether individuals had high or low medical spending. Additionally, it decreased the probability of being pretty happy and having high medical expenses, while increasing the probability among those with lower expenses. Concerning the probability of being very happy, the OHP only had a positive effect on being very happy and spending less, and its effect on those with high expenses was insignificant. These findings align with the benefit of Medicaid: alleviating financial burden, contributing to the well-being of distinct subgroups.

                Early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of- the-art accuracy in the early detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g., model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2vec, and vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy = 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

                This paper introduces an autonomous robot (AR) cart to execute the last mile delivery task. We use navigation and intelligent avoidance algorithms to plan the path of the automatic robot. When AR encounters a new unrecognizable terrain, it will give control to the customer who can control the AR on its mobile app and navigate to the specified destination. We have initially designed an autonomous delivery robot with the cost of 2774 dollars.
